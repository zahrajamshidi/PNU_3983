00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:02,06
- UX job seekers are often asked

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:06,00
to share a portfolio of prior work

3
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:09,06
to establish that they have the appropriate experiences.

4
00:00:09,06 --> 00:00:12,05
Portfolios are an inherently tricky thing, however,

5
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:15,02
since often by definition a portfolio showcases work

6
00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:17,04
at prior jobs and those jobs might

7
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:21,05
require nondisclosure agreements or NDAs.

8
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:23,01
While the NDAs at other companies

9
00:00:23,01 --> 00:00:25,01
shouldn't really be your problem,

10
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:26,08
you may run into job candidates

11
00:00:26,08 --> 00:00:28,02
who tell you that they are hindered

12
00:00:28,02 --> 00:00:30,07
by the rules of their agreements.

13
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:33,01
There's a hierarchy of what can be shared.

14
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:34,07
If you find a good candidate but want some evidence

15
00:00:34,07 --> 00:00:36,08
of prior experience it could be up to you

16
00:00:36,08 --> 00:00:38,06
to help them figure out what

17
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:41,03
is okay to share and in what way.

18
00:00:41,03 --> 00:00:43,05
If they aren't constrained by an NDA at all

19
00:00:43,05 --> 00:00:45,08
then sharing full work is certainly preferable.

20
00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:49,00
Not only the final effort which may be public anyway

21
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:51,03
but also their pieces of the design,

22
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:52,07
or research, or strategic thinking

23
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:54,09
that went in to creating that effort.

24
00:00:54,09 --> 00:00:57,01
If they have constraints with sharing actual items

25
00:00:57,01 --> 00:00:59,00
in their portfolio, discuss with them whether

26
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:02,09
it's possible to strip out or blur confidential parts.

27
00:01:02,09 --> 00:01:04,06
If all else fails, ask them to explain

28
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:08,01
the narrative of what they did and their work process.

29
00:01:08,01 --> 00:01:09,06
They can avoid mentioning anything

30
00:01:09,06 --> 00:01:11,02
that is truly confidential

31
00:01:11,02 --> 00:01:12,03
and you can get an understanding

32
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:16,02
about how they perceive user experience and their role.

33
00:01:16,02 --> 00:01:17,09
In some ways this framing is even better

34
00:01:17,09 --> 00:01:20,01
than the actual items.

35
00:01:20,01 --> 00:01:22,09
While it feels good to get to see what they are showing,

36
00:01:22,09 --> 00:01:24,04
often these deliverables are part

37
00:01:24,04 --> 00:01:26,07
of a team effort anyway.

38
00:01:26,07 --> 00:01:29,05
Understanding the narrative of how they work,

39
00:01:29,05 --> 00:01:32,09
and what their role was, and how they perceive the effort,

40
00:01:32,09 --> 00:01:34,01
really can help you understand

41
00:01:34,01 --> 00:01:37,00
how they can help you and your business.
