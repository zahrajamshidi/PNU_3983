1
00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:04,05
- UX professionals tend to be information seekers.

2
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:07,00
They often want to grow their professional skill set

3
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:09,03
and knowledge, so help them.

4
00:00:09,03 --> 00:00:11,03
It may seem counterintuitive,

5
00:00:11,03 --> 00:00:14,03
but your job is to give them the skills, knowledge

6
00:00:14,03 --> 00:00:16,05
and confidence that they'll need so they can be

7
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:19,06
an excellent candidate in the future job market.

8
00:00:19,06 --> 00:00:21,03
Are they going to stay with you forever?

9
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:22,07
Probably not,

10
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:24,08
but giving them what they need to move on

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,09
doesn't mean that they will move on.

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:30,02
It means that they will respect and appreciate you.

13
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:33,00
Combined with a salary that's on par with the industry,

14
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,02
and a generally positive work environment,

15
00:00:35,02 --> 00:00:38,07
that respect is going to make them all the more valuable.

16
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:40,02
Support learning.

17
00:00:40,02 --> 00:00:42,08
Support the purchase of books and dare I say it,

18
00:00:42,08 --> 00:00:44,04
a subscription to LinkedIn Learning

19
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:47,07
and other video and online learning resources.

20
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:50,02
Support attending events, local events

21
00:00:50,02 --> 00:00:52,05
and national, international conferences

22
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:55,05
and support your staff speaking at those events,

23
00:00:55,05 --> 00:00:59,05
where you also then get implicit promotion of your company.

24
00:00:59,05 --> 00:01:02,01
You can also consider hosting your own events,

25
00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:05,08
where you task your employees with helping to run the event.

26
00:01:05,08 --> 00:01:08,04
I can tell you from experience that running events

27
00:01:08,04 --> 00:01:10,09
provides a wonderful opportunity for visibility

28
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:12,04
and appreciation,

29
00:01:12,04 --> 00:01:14,06
where your employees won't feel like wallflowers,

30
00:01:14,06 --> 00:01:18,07
as they do the necessary tasks to make your event a success.

31
00:01:18,07 --> 00:01:20,07
And help employees by framing

32
00:01:20,07 --> 00:01:23,00
a valid career pathway for them.

33
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:25,05
Show them how they can move up in your company

34
00:01:25,05 --> 00:01:28,03
and provide them with leadership skills.

35
00:01:28,03 --> 00:01:32,05
Note that not every UX leader has to be a manager of others.

36
00:01:32,05 --> 00:01:34,09
While management of UX staff or UX projects

37
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:38,02
are certainly valid and important career pathways for some,

38
00:01:38,02 --> 00:01:41,01
practitioner seniority itself, with opportunities

39
00:01:41,01 --> 00:01:43,02
to mentor and demonstrate by example

40
00:01:43,02 --> 00:01:47,00
is another form of leadership, as is thought leadership.

41
00:01:47,00 --> 00:01:51,00
So encourage blogging and writing UX related articles.

42
00:01:51,00 --> 00:01:52,08
We talked about how UX is a field

43
00:01:52,08 --> 00:01:55,08
that constantly deals with change, so growing and learning

44
00:01:55,08 --> 00:01:58,07
are critical traits of UX professionals.

45
00:01:58,07 --> 00:02:01,00
By encouraging their writing, you are helping them

46
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:03,02
to help others to grow.

47
00:02:03,02 --> 00:02:04,08
And while you can get your employees

48
00:02:04,08 --> 00:02:07,06
to help host your own events, you can also encourage them

49
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:11,01
to be UX leaders out in the wider UX community.

50
00:02:11,01 --> 00:02:12,04
Almost by definition,

51
00:02:12,04 --> 00:02:15,09
UX is composed of people who value people.

52
00:02:15,09 --> 00:02:17,08
As such, this may very well be

53
00:02:17,08 --> 00:02:21,03
why UXers so frequently enjoy being a part of local,

54
00:02:21,03 --> 00:02:24,00
national and international communities.

55
00:02:24,00 --> 00:02:26,09
Help your UXers do what they do naturally,

56
00:02:26,09 --> 00:02:30,09
be a part of and build socially cohesive communities,

57
00:02:30,09 --> 00:02:34,02
and the satisfaction that they gain from UX social cohesion

58
00:02:34,02 --> 00:02:37,09
can also extend to their satisfaction with your workplace.

59
00:02:37,09 --> 00:02:40,05
If you're involved in managing UX professionals,

60
00:02:40,05 --> 00:02:42,07
set a good example as a caring leader,

61
00:02:42,07 --> 00:02:44,09
who wants what is best for employees

62
00:02:44,09 --> 00:02:47,07
and do your part to create an environment

63
00:02:47,07 --> 00:02:51,00
where UX growth and leadership, however it's defined,

64
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:53,00
is second nature.
