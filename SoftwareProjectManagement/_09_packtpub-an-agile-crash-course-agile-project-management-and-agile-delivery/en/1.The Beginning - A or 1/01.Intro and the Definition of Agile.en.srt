00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,539
Welcome to the Agile Crash Course,
these scores will cover the most important

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,500
concepts and tools of agile development
and agile project management. But I should

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,969
note that agile is not only for the IT industry,
nor just for developers

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:20,430
or project managers, actually anyone
can apply agile across different industries

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,479
in almost any project. But I'll go over
which projects are better suited for agile

6
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,940
later in the course. For now, let's
just go over the basics. So let's start

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,319
by answering what is probably the most
important question in this course, what

8
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:39,710
is agile? You probably heard the term
a couple of times and we're wondering what

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,850
it meant, how it was different to what
you were already doing and whether

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,100
it was actually good or not. Well, I have
good news for you. If you are able

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,850
to understand the pictures you are seeing
on your screen right now, then you're

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,669
already going through the learning
process of understanding what agile means

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,100
because it's pretty much what you're
seeing there. Seriously, it's just that

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,690
simple. This summarizes what agile
is and what it means as a methodology

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,400
for delivering projects. And I wanted
to give you an analogy, because I know

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,360
it will help you understand it better.
So let's start with the left side at the top.

17
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,880
You have the process or traditional
project delivery. As you can see, we start

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,480
to build the whole car ride, the Ferrari,
the best product that has everything,

19
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,020
all the requirements and all the bells
and whistles. And we don't consider a project

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,510
done until we reach that stage. So the actual
delivery can take many months

21
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,989
and sometimes even years. And the customer
might not be happy along the way

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,980
since he's just waiting and waiting to get
something. But agile is quite different.

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,330
Look at the pig below that. Do you see
it? Agile is an iterative process

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,680
in which you deliver value through a basic
solution and then enhance it over time,

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,290
you deliver quickly and you deliver
often throughout the whole process. You have

26
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,370
constant communication and interaction
with your customer to ensure he's happy

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,019
with every product you give him. He can
actually start using even your first

28
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,299
iteration, the skateboard, to go
from point A to be sure, it would be nice

29
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:19,649
to have a car. But isn't a skateboard
better than nothing? Isn't it better

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,690
to have a skateboard while you build
the car? That is precisely what Agile does.

31
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,309
So let's put this into a real web
development example. Say you were building

32
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,179
a website to sell products on different
categories, flavors and colors in Agile.

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,449
You wouldn't spend months building that
website. Instead, you would create a basic

34
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,099
first iteration, maybe just the homepage
you'll get started and to get the concept

35
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:49,709
out there and then you would enhance
it over time and start adding to it more

36
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:55,589
and more pages to the website. More
and more product features over time in Agile.

37
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,649
We call that period of time
sprints and sprints less generally two weeks.

38
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,309
Now let's shift our attention to the right.
Do you see the sofa? The analogy

39
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,979
also explains a key concept in agile.
Keep it simple. Build the minimum. You really

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,259
need to deliver what the customer
expects. And that relates to another key concept

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,779
in Agile, which we called the MVP
or minimum viable product. So it's

42
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,099
the minimum you can deliver, which satisfies
the basic requirement. So like

43
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,289
the tire with the rope. So let's
recap about the concept of agile, agile

44
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,809
is a methodology to deliver
incrementally, it's imperative on time boxed and that

45
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,009
period of time, which is generally
two weeks, is what we call sprints. And what

46
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,579
you work on during those two weeks,
which are basically features that give value

47
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:50,110
to the customer, are what we call user
stories. But don't worry about the terms.

48
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,789
You'll learn them over time and I'll
go over this in more detail later

49
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,110
in the course. For now, I just want you to start
getting familiar with the concepts

50
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,389
and terminology we use in agile, such as
sprints and user stories. And if you ever

51
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,669
hear the word iteration and get
confused, don't be iteration is just another word

52
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,479
for Sprint, which, as you just
learned, is just a period of time to do something.

53
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:18,339
Generally two weeks, but sometimes
even three or four. That is something

54
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,899
for the project team to decide.
